						<span>Cookies.</span> "Cookies" are a feature on your browser software. If enabled, we may write
						cookies that may store small amounts of data on your computer about your visit to any of the
						pages of this Site. Cookies assist us in tracking which of our features appeal the most to you
						and what content you may have viewed on past visits. When you visit this site again, cookies can
						enable us to customize our content according to your preferences. We may use cookies to: keep
						track of the number of return visits to this site; accumulate and report aggregate, statistical
						information on website usage; deliver specific content to you based on your interests or past
						viewing history; save your password for ease of access to our Site. You can disable cookies,

						about cookies at http://cookiecentral.com. In order to use all of the features and functionality
						of Company's websites, you need to accept cookies.</p>

					<p>
						<span><b>Web Beacons.</b></span> A web beacon is a programming code that can be used to display
						an image on a web page, but can also be used to transfer your unique user identification to a
						database and associate you with previously acquired information about an individual in a
						database. This allows Company to track certain websites you visit. Web beacons are used to track
						online behavioral habits for marketing purposes to determine products or services you may be
						interested in. In addition to using web beacons on web pages, Company also uses web beacons in
						email messages sent to individuals listed in Company's database.</p>

						computer browser information, and your IP address. Your Internet Protocol ("IP") is a unique

						area network ("LAN"), DSL, or cable modem users, an IP address may be permanently assigned to a
						particular computer. IP addresses are automatically logged by Web servers, collecting
						information about a user's traffic patterns. While the IP address does not identify an

						individual using the Web. Your IP address can, however, reveal what geographic area you are
						connecting from, or which ISP you are using. Finally, other websites you visit have IP
						addresses, and we may collect the IP addresses of those websites and their pages. </p>
